## Enabling Project Logging

Logging for individual projects can be configured separately from logging at the cluster level. 

### To enable project logging within Rancher:

* Navigate to the desired project
* Select `Resources > Logging` from the navigation bar
* Select and configure the desired logging target from the options presented at the top of the page
* Click `Save`, located below the configuration fields
* After a brief period of time, logs originating from the project will be forwarded to the configured target.

### Configuration Notes:

* The configured logging target must be available and ready to access through its endpoint
* Custom log fields (key/value pairs) can be included in the forwarded logs to assist in filtering. These are available to all logging targets.
